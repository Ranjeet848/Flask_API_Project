# Flask_API_Project
INTRODUCTION

In this code snippet, we import the necessary modules (Flask, request, jsonify, and openai) and create a Flask application instance.  Replace API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key obtained from the OpenAI platform.  I define a route /chat that handles POST.

First, 
you need to create your Flask app and install the OpenAI module, which can be accomplished by using pip install openai in your terminal. Once you have installed the module, import it into your Flask application, allowing you to use its functions to send requests to the OpenAI API.

What is Flask and Why Use It?

Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. It's designed for quick development of web applications by wrapping around Werkzeug(*1) and Jinja(*2). 
Its simplicity and ability to scale up to complex applications make it an ideal choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. 
Flask requires little to no boilerplate code for simple applications, making it straightforward to use for quick prototyping but also powerful enough for large-scale applications.
